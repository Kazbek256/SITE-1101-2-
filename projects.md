      <h3>Project 1 — Building Logic Gates</h3>
      <p>Our team of four successfully designed and built AND, NOT, OR, XOR, and NAND logic gates as part of this project, carefully testing each gate to ensure correct functionality. I personally implemented the AND gate twice and the OR gate once, refining the logic and debugging along the way. To showcase our work, we recorded a fun, Marvel-themed walkthrough of the project, which is available on
