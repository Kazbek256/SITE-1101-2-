## About me

I’m an Information Technology student at ADA University with a growing interest in how software and digital systems work on both the logical and practical levels. I’ve completed CS50 and worked on a group project where we built OR, AND, NOT, XOR, and NAND logic gates, which helped me understand the fundamentals behind computing. I’m now developing my skills through web projects, exploring tools like Jekyll, GitHub, and modern front-end development, and working toward becoming a well-rounded IT professional.

### Background & Qualifications

- Completed the CS50 course, covering C, Python, SQL, and web fundamentals.
- Attended the Holberton Python bootcamp to deepen programming skills.
- Exploring how software and digital systems work through hands-on projects.

### Activities

I’m currently building small programming and web projects, developing my portfolio, and exploring new tools. I tutor beginners in programming and help them work through core concepts. I’m also preparing for the next ICPC tournament by practicing problem-solving and strengthening my competitive programming skills, while continuing to experiment with Python and improve my workflow with Git and GitHub.
